# ðŸ“ˆ Forecasting Project  

## Project Summary  
This project focuses on **time series forecasting** across two domains:  
1. **EU Trip Expenditures**  
2. **U.S. Airline Passenger Traffic**  

The objective was to explore, model, and evaluate forecasting techniques using real-world datasets, with special attention to the impact of **COVID-19** on both European tourism and U.S. aviation.

## ðŸ”¹ Part 1: EU Trip Expenditures Forecasting  
- **Dataset**: Average nightly expenditures of EU citizens traveling within EU countries (2012â€“2022).  
- **Methods Applied**:  
  - Seasonal NaÃ¯ve, STL decomposition, ETS, Auto-ETS, ARIMA, Auto-ARIMA, TBATS, and NNAR.  
- **Key Findings**:  
  - **ARIMA(0,1,1)(0,1,1)[12]** delivered the best accuracy and stable residuals.  
  - Forecasts for 2020â€“2024 reveal seasonal peaks in March, September, and October.  
  - COVID-19 caused a **sharp decline in expenditures** (2020â€“2021), with observed spending much lower than predicted values.

## ðŸ”¹ Part 2: U.S. Airline Passenger Forecasting  
- **Dataset**: Monthly U.S. domestic airline passenger traffic (2003â€“2023).  
- **Methods Applied**:  
  - Seasonal NaÃ¯ve, STL decomposition, Holt-Winters (additive & multiplicative), ETS, and ARIMA.  
- **Key Findings**:  
  - **ARIMA(1,1,0)(0,1,2)[12]** proved most effective, outperforming other models.  
  - Holt-Winters additive method also showed strong accuracy but weaker residual diagnostics.  
  - COVID-19 led to a **drastic passenger decline** in early 2020, and full recovery has yet to be achieved by 2023.

## ðŸš€ Techniques & Tools  
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: time series plots, seasonal plots, ACF/PACF analysis.  
- **Forecasting Models**: NaÃ¯ve, STL, ETS, ARIMA, TBATS, NNAR.  
- **Model Evaluation**: RMSE, MAE, MAPE, MASE + residual diagnostics (Ljung-Box test).  
- **Software**: R (forecasting libraries, time series functions).

## ðŸ“Œ Conclusion  
- **EU Tourism**: ARIMA-based models captured seasonality best; forecasts confirmed heavy COVID-19 disruption.  
- **U.S. Aviation**: ARIMA was the most reliable for long-term trends; results highlighted the severe pandemic-driven drop in traffic.
